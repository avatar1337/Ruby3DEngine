Ruby 3D Engine
============

-=This is my software 3D Engine in Java=-

Why is it called Ruby?

Well, the first thing I tested in my 3D Engine was a computer generated diamond shaped model with the color red.
I then decided to call it Ruby. It is not related to the programming language Ruby at all.

When I was 16 I created my first 3D Engine. I didn't want to research how you made one, so I had to figure everything out
for myself. When I got a bit older, with knowledge in linear algebra, I wanted to write a new 3D engine, but this time
in Java.

This repository contains STL files that you can play around with.
STL files are simple 3D model files containing very basic information.

This is released as open source. I hope you Enjoy playing around with it.
Please let me know if you like it.
